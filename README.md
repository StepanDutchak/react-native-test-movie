# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

# Versions 

Node - v16.20.2

## Step 1: Setup modules

- in root directory - npm install
- cd ios => pod install
- in root directory - npm run postinstall


## Step 2: Start your Application

### For Android

# using npm
 - open andoid emulator (I use - Pixel 3a_API 31_ arm64-v8a )
 - npm run android

### For iOS


# using npm
 - open IOS emulator (I use - Iphone 14 (IOS:16.4))
npm run ios


If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your my test app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
